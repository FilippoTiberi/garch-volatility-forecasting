# Volatility Forecasting with GARCH and Deep Learning

Author: **Filippo Tiberi** — BSc Finance (Bocconi)

This project builds on the `finrisk-analytics` framework by atahabilder1 and extends it with:

- A structured volatility modelling comparison:
  - GARCH(1,1)
  - EGARCH
  - Heston–Nandi GARCH
  - LSTM and GRU neural networks
- A unified VaR engine with:
  - Kupiec POF test
  - Christoffersen conditional coverage test

The goal is to provide a research-style pipeline for volatility forecasting and risk backtesting, suitable for quant finance applications.
